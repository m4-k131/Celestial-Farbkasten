# Astro-Imaging Scripts

A collection of scripts to query, download, process, and combine astronomical data into a final image.

---

## 1. query_observation_lists.py

This script queries the MAST archive for observation data of a specific target and saves the results to a CSV file.

* `--target_name` (required): The name of the celestial object to query.
* `--calib_level` (optional, default: 3): The calibration level of the data.
* `--project` (optional, default: JWST): The telescope or project to query.
* `--outdir` (optional, default: outs_csv): The output directory for the CSV file.

## 2. download_from_csv.py

This script downloads the actual data files (FITS, JPG) listed in the CSV generated by the query script.

* `--csv` (required): Path to the input CSV file.
* `--outdir` (optional): The directory where files will be saved.
* `--ignore_jpgs` (optional): A flag to skip downloading JPG preview images.
* `--ignore_fits` (optional): A flag to skip downloading scientific FITS files.
* `--must_contain` (optional): A filter string that must be in the filename to be downloaded.

---

## 3. extract_png_from_fits.py

This script processes and aligns scientific FITS files into 8-bit PNG images. It uses a JSON configuration file to define which files to process and what parameters to use for visual scaling.

* `--input_json` (required): Path to the JSON file that configures the FITS processing.
* `--outdir` (optional): The directory where the output PNGs will be saved.

## 4. combiner.py

This script combines several processed PNGs into a single full-color composite image. It uses a JSON configuration file to assign specific images to color channels and set their brightness.

* `--input_json` (required): Path to the JSON file that configures the image combination.
* `--imagename` (optional): The base name for the final output image.
* `--suffix` (optional): A suffix to append to the output filename.
* `--outdir` (optional, default: outs): The directory for the final image.
