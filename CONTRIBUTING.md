## How Can I Contribute?

There are many ways to contribute, from writing code and improving documentation to submitting bug reports and feature requests. Any contribution is valued.

### Reporting Bugs

If you encounter a bug, please create an issue on GitHub. A well-written bug report helps us solve the issue faster. Please include:

* A clear and descriptive title.
* A detailed description of the problem, including the steps to reproduce it.
* The expected behavior versus the actual behavior.
* Any relevant error messages, logs, or screenshots.

### Suggesting Enhancements

If you have an idea for a new feature or an improvement to an existing one, please open an issue to discuss it. This helps us track suggestions and allows for community discussion before development begins.

### Code Contributions

If you'd like to contribute code, please follow these steps:

1.  **Fork the repository** to your own GitHub account.
2.  **Create a new branch** for your feature or bug fix (e.g., `git checkout -b feature/amazing-new-filter`).
3.  **Make your changes** and commit them with a clear and concise message.
4.  **Push your branch** to your fork (`git push origin feature/amazing-new-filter`).
5.  **Open a pull request** to the `main` branch of the Celestial-Farbkasten repository.

**Specific Guidelines for JSON Configurations:**

* If you are contributing a new configuration or parameter set via a `.json` file, please **include the resulting image** in your pull request. You can add it to the description of the PR to showcase the result.

Please ensure that your code adheres to the existing style and that you've tested your changes.
